# ðŸ“„ Agentic Workflow for Data Science Resume Tailoring

## Overview

This project applies an agentic workflow to reshape a resume and interview prep strategy for Data Scientist positions.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Job Description Parsing
Key role requirements from the job description are extracted, including:

- _Skills & Tools:_ Python, SQL, Pandas, Tableau, R, Spark, etc.
- _Methods:_ A/B testing, causal inference, experiment design and predictive modeling.
- _Qualifications:_ Master's or PhD in a quantitative field and years of experience.

### 2. Resume Evaluation
- Load the original resume in (`.pdf`).
- Identifies alignment and gaps between the candidateâ€™s background and the job requirements.

### 3. Resume Reshaping
- Rewrites the professional summary to better reflect ML experimentation, LLM pipelines and business impact.
- Reorganizes experience and adds clearer, quantified outcomes.
- Groups skills into ATS friendly categories using a tag-based visual design.

### 4. Resume Rewriting & Export
- Final resume rendered as a visually clean, responsive `.html` document for readability and design consistency.

### 5. Diff-Based Comparison
- `difflib` is use to compare the original and tailored resume line-by-line, highlighting additions, deletions and edits.
- The output is saved as `resume_diff.txt` for review.

### 6. Summary of Resume Changes
- A full markdown summary of changes is included in the notebook, explaining what changed and why.

### 7. Interview Talking Points
- [âœ… Placeholder] A set of 5â€“7 talking points were (or will be) generated to prepare for a recruiter screen or first-round interview â€” focusing on LLM, experimentation, business alignment, and analytics communication.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This project demonstrates how data science principles â€” such as semantic matching, pipeline design, feature engineering (resume content), and output validation â€” can be applied to the job search process. It encourages intentional, optimized self-representation based on data and strategy rather than guesswork.

The approach mirrors what a data scientist might do for customer targeting or modeling: align the product (you) with market demand (the job), optimize, and evaluate the result.
